## CVE-2018-9525

-   Status: Completed.

-   Description: In the AndroidManifest.xml file defining the SliceBroadcastReceiver handler for com.android.settings.slice.action.WIFI_CHANGED, there is a possible permissions bypass due to a confused deputy. This could lead to local escalation of privilege, allowing a local attacker to change device settings, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

-   Type: EoP

-   Severity: High

-   Exploit: Send an intent to the SettingsSlice provider with an extra uri to change some settings. I was able to activate/de-activate wifi and bluetooth without needing any permission.

-   Patch: Not needed since the broadcast intent can't leave the virtualapp environment by design.
