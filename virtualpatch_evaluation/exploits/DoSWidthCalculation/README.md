## CVE-2018-9452

-   Status: Completed but patch has some limitations.

-   Description: In getOffsetForHorizontal of Layout.java, there is a possible application hang due to a slow width calculation. This could lead to remote denial of service if a contact with many hidden unicode characters were sent to the device and used by a local app, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.

-   Type: DoS

-   Severity: Moderate

3. [Google Source computational complexity](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/3b6f84b77c30ec0bab5147b0cffc192c86ba2634)

-   Exploit: Malicious app creates a specially crafted Contact with many hidden LTR and RTL characters and then displays it. Interacting with the text makes the app crash.

-   Patch: Proposed ones from Google for both for offest check and computational complexity.
